Hi! You might be wondering what Goonstation exactly is.

To put it short, we're developers of a multiplayer sci-fi sandbox simulation video game.

To put it a bit longer, 'Goonstation' is the longest running [Space Station 13 (SS13)](https://spacestation13.com/) community established way back in 2008.
Built on top of the original 2003 source code, all SS13 forks are derived from our codebase. 
The general SS13 community has a [large presence on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/ss13), being the largest open-source video game project.

To get involved and contribute, check out our community below.
